No longer being developed. Mostly old and navie scala code.

SentenceBoundaryDetection
=========================
An unsupervised senetence boundary detector in scala. 
It is based on the assumption that a large number of ambiguities in the determination
of sentence boundaries can be eliminated once abbreviations have been identiﬁed. 
Instead of relying on orthographic clues, the proposed system is able to detect abbreviations with high
accuracy using three criteria that only require information about the candidate type itself and
are independent of context: Abbreviations can be deﬁned as a very tight collocation consisting
of a truncated word and a ﬁnal period, abbreviations are usually short, and abbreviations
sometimes contain internal periods.
